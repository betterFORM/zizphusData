				<ext:value>explanatory comments/crosstagging:
Story line of the movie: Mirza Baig and his wife live a wealthy lifestyle in Jaipur, India. They have been married for 15 years but have been unable to conceive. They have prayed and visited a number of holy Islamic sites, save for the Dhargah of Khwaja Gharib Nawaz in Ajmer. The couple travel to this holy site, which is thronged by Hindu, Sikh, Christian, and Muslim devotees, pray, and return home. Months later they are blessed with the birth of a baby boy who they name Yusuf. When Yusuf is 3, they re-visit the Dhargah for placing a Manat Ki Chaddhar. Years later Yusuf has grown up, has secured first class first in college and is considered a very eligible bachelor. His parents arrange his marriage, much to his dismay, a he has fallen in love with fellow-collegian, Salma, who comes from a middle-class background. He does not oppose his parents' choice and gets married - but is delighted when he finds out later that his bride is none other than Salma herself... (gs)</ext:value>
				<ext:value>explanatory comments/crosstagging:
There have been various speculations about the mystical or religious significance of 786 in Islam for centuries. There is a famous poem praising Allah, titled Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim, which has exactly 786 letters. Some have argued that 786 is the number of days in which Allah created the world or the number of days in which Muhammad conquered the pagans of Mecca.
All Arabic copies of the Koran have the mysterious figure 786 imprinted on them . No Arabic scholar has been able to determine the choice of this particular number as divine. It is an established fact that Muhammad was illiterate therefore it is obvious that he would not be able to differentiate numbers from letters.
This &quot;magical&quot; number is none other than the Vedic holy letter &quot;aum&quot; written in Sanskrit (see the figure at the right). Anyone who knows Sanskrit can try reading the symbol for &quot;aum&quot; backwards in the Arabic way and magically the numbers 786 will appear! Muslims in their ignorance simply do not realise that this special number is nothing more than the holiest of Vedic symbols misread.
