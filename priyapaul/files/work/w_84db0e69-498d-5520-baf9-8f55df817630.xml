				<text>The image shows Lord Krishna standing with a couple, Yudhistira and Draupadi, in front of a hut with a thatched roof. Draupadi kneels down as she holds an earthen pot. Yudhiatira is wearing a scared thread across his shoulders and folds in hands in front of his chest. Krishna, Yudhistira and Draupadi have glitter embossed into their clothes. Krishna is depicted with a halo around his head, and he is wearing a crown, a flower garland and jewellery. In the background, a forest with trees can be seen.</text>

				<ext:value>explanatory comments/crosstagging:
When the Pandavas began their exile in the forest, Yudhishtra was despondent at his inability to feed the holy sages and others who accompanied him. At this, Dhaumya, the priest of the Pandavas, counselled him to pray to Lord Surya. Pleased with Yudhishtira's prayers, Lord Surya blessed him with the Akshaya Patra, a vessel that would give unlimited food every day till Draupadi finished eating.
 
Lord Krishna also once partakes food from the Akshaya Patra, when sage Durvasa arrived at the Pandavas' place with his disciples. When Durvasa arrived, there was no food left to serve him, since Draupadi had already finished eating. The Pandavas became anxious as to what they would feed such a venerable sage. While Durvasa and his disciples were away at the banks of the river bathing, Draupadi prayed to Lord Krishna for help. As always, they were once again saved by Him, who partook of a single grain of rice from the Akshaya Patra and announced that He was satisfied by the meal. This satiated the hunger of Durvasa and all his disciples too, as the satisfaction of Lord Krishna meant the satiation of the hunger of the whole Universe.</ext:value>
