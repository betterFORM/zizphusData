				<ext:value>explanatory comments/crosstagging:
In a small village of Konkan called Revandi, the villagers have gathered to perform a story from the epic Mahabharata, that of Draupadi Vastraharan – the disrobing of Draupadi. The village Head Tatya Sarpanch is at the helm of affairs, while the village teacher, Joshi Master is the director. Tatya is keen that people from all over the region watch his play and shower praise on him. He is doing his utmost to get the act together. After rigorous rehearsals for a month and a half, the play is now ready to be staged.
The amateur actors of the village are bursting with enthusiasm to put up the play, but they have their whims and fancies coupled with tricky, badly-timed real life situations. As a result, the drama that happens behind the scenes turns out to be far more theatrical than the actual play. Vastraharan is the fun-filled, humorous story of that drama.
Every traditional play in Maharashtra starts with Nandi, or invocation to the gods. As the Nandi is about to start, they find the musicians missing. They have been whisked away to perform at the funeral of an old woman of the village who has died at the age of 100. So what happens to the music of the ‘musical’ Vastraharan?
The man playing Draupadi gets the news that his wife has given birth to his eighth child – a son after seven girls. He leaves the stage, runs home and gets dead drunk! Who then plays Draupadi?
The actor playing Lord Indra gets actually possessed by a god (!) and ‘demands’ that the Tamasha dancer sitting in the audience perform for him. Is his demand met?
Dusshasan, the villain who is supposed to do the disrobing, refuses to disrobe the new Draupadi. Who then fills his place?
