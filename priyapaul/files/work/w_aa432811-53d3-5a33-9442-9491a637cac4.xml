				<hra:value>explanatory comments/crosstagging:
Nainital was one of the few places with a natural lake. Bodies of water were considered very desirable in picturesque views.  Nainital was even described as “the Westmoreland of the Kumaun” by an enthusiastic colonial official. (Shashwati Talukdar)(gs)</hra:value>
				<hra:value>explanatory comments/crosstagging:
The north-west view of Nainital in this image with its beautiful lake, pretty cottages and verdant hills does not show an accidental landscape. The trees and cottages have been placed in the picture, and  their geographical location is shaped by the logic of colonial discourse. In other words, to make Nainital look like the Alpine shores of Lake Geneva took some work.  A European aesthetic of landscape had to be imported in, and the landscape had to be viewed through the  lens of that particular aesthetic in order to make it amenable to colonial society. (Shashwati Talukdar)(gs)</hra:value>
				<hra:value>explanatory comments/crosstagging:
The picturesque aesthetic was a way of seeing that emphasized the suitability of a scene to be included in a picture, that is, it was pictorially assimilable. This was the dominant aesthetic used in the colonies to not only portray the landscape, but to also change it. Hill station picture postcards show how this aesthetic was used to make &quot;mountains&quot; into &quot;hills.&quot; They show us the aesthetic shifts that took place in order to create a &quot;home away from home.&quot; (Shashwati Talukdar)(gs)</hra:value>
				<hra:value>explanatory comments/crosstagging:
Picture postcards were immensely popular in Europe and its colonies between the 1890s and the First World War. The fact that this period also coincides with the heyday of European imperialism is not mere coincidence.  As Saloni Mathur points out, the picture postcard is “both a cosmopolitan form and a constant reminder of the imperial conditions that establish a basis for modern cosmopolitanism.” Considering how the postcard culture was produced by the material conditions of empire, it is no surprise that postcards, especially the colonial postcard, were particularly well suited to encode the project of empire with all its attendant anxieties and feats of discursive gymnastics.
