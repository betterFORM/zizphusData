				<ext:value>explanatory comments/crosstagging:
Louis Dufay produced photographic plates with a micro-colour-screen between 1910 and 1917.  They were known as the Dufay 'Dioptrechrome Plate'.  From 1925 a large number of patents were granted for various aspects of the Spicer-Dufay Process. The films have the reseau mechanically printed on the base of the film.  The film has to be exposed through the base. The method of printing the reseau on the film base can be seen  in the illustration from the Dufaycolor Book above. First films were B/W reversal.  The invention by Dr D A Spencer of Kodak Ltd in 1936 of the 'depth developer' made the negative/positive process possible.  This restricted the development to the layer of emulsion next to the reseau on the base.  This prevented spread of the image which caused desaturation of the colours. In addition the negative reseau had red lines at an angle of 27 degrees to the edge of film and 45 degrees in the positive film to prevent moire fringes when printing.  There was however, desaturation of the colours caused by overlapping of the colour lines.
