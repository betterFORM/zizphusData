				<ext:value>explanatory comments/crosstagging:
Lord Krishna saved the people of Braj from torrents of rain for seven days by holding Govardhan Parvat on his small finger. Due to a scarcity of rainfall the people of Braj prayed ardently to Lord Indra for rain. However, Krishna came up and persuaded them to give up the worship for Lord Indra and instead pray to the supreme power the Sun God. He also said that Indra is no supreme God. Woods, streams and hills should be worshipped for rains. He especially asked the Braj folk to pray Mount Govardhan, who is sure to bring rain in their land. The people of Brindavan brought flowers, fruits and other religious offerings to the mountain and started to pray. mean while, Lord Indra was enraged at the insult. He called for the King of Clouds and decreed him to rain over Braj, until the entire land along with the Govardhan Parvat was flooded. An army of clouds covered the sky over Braj and torrential rain poured down over the land and its people. All of them came running to Krishna for help. 
Lord Krishna picked up Govardhan Parvat on his little finger. The people of Braj, along with their cattle and belongings took shelter under the mountain. The torrents of water fell for almost one whole week but not a single drop of water fell in Braj. Eventually Lord Indra gave up the conflict and realised that the person who withstood his anger and power can be none other than Lord Vishnu.
The next day, when Lord Krishna and his brother Balaram went to the fields along with their friends, Lord Indra came down from heaven upon his elephant Airavata and apologised to Krishna. (gs/sp)</ext:value>
