				<hra:value>explanatory comments/crosstagging:
Renu lives a poor lifestyle with her mom, dad and a brother. Her dad decides to travel to Africa so that he can earn enough money to send his son to study engineering, so that he can find employment abroad. But fate has other plans when one day Renu's brother returns home sick from college, and shortly thereafter passes away. His shocked father books a seat on a plane to attend his son's funeral, but the plane crashes killing everyone on board. Shattered and devastated, Renu decides to hide her dad's death from her ill and fragile mom, and goes along pretending that her father is still alive. She obtains employment and through her earnings convinces her mom that her dad is regularly sending money. Then things brighten up when a homeless young man, Anand, enters her life, both fall in love with each other and want to get married. But once again fate plays a cruel joke on Renu as she subsequently finds out that Anand is not who he claims to be... Renu lives a poor lifestyle with her mom, dad and a brother.
