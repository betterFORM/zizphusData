				<hra:value>explanatory comments/crosstagging:
This image could be from Europe, as opposed to the Bengal Presidency. This is not an accident when one thinks of how hill stations were constructed to be a &quot;home away from home.&quot;  However, it could also very well be titled &quot;The little steam engine that could,&quot; the very picture of industrious activity and indomitable spirit that colonial men especially prided themselves on. (Shashwati Talukdar)(gs)</hra:value>
				<hra:value>explanatory comments/crosstagging:
The presence of the train in the image accomplishes several of the things that the picturesque aesthetic was tasked with, foremost of which was that it implied ownership and property—whether it was the image of a beautiful woman, or of a landscape.  The pictured object’s ability to produce pleasure, status or economic gain conferred a certain value to the owner (viewer) of the image. So imposing a picturesque  aesthetic on an alien landscape was one way of appropriating and taming it.  This appropriation was tied to notions of property and class, to who could afford to possess unproductive land and had the education to appreciate the landscape. The economic potential of the land was a subterranean factor in this enjoyment, and it could be argued a necessary component of it. This potential for future wealth embedded in the picturesque aesthetic was highly resonant in the colonies.  Hence the train in the hills. It not only makes the picture more pleasing, it also makes it very clear to whom the hills belong— namely, the people who put the train there.  Thus even as the train enhances the picture by following a graceful loop around the hill, its path also functions as a marker of an enclosed piece of land. (Shashwati Talukdar)(gs)</hra:value>
				<hra:value>explanatory comments/crosstagging:
Darjeeling was one of the few places where plantations succeeded. The railway boom of the 1850s played an important role in the plantation economy's success. In the mid 19th century it took five arduous days to get (from Kolkata) to Darjeeling. With the building of the railway the journey was cut down to twenty one hours. (Shashwati Talukdar)(gs)</hra:value>
				<hra:value>explanatory comments/crosstagging:
It is hard to dismiss the importance of the train itself which was the means to extend both leisure and commerce through the second half of the 19th century and well into the 20th; it was both the means to transport viewers to pleasing views, and also the engine of commercial activity.  The valorization of mobility in the train postcard is also significant in the light of how ideas and institutions were moved and transplanted between the colony and the metropole.
